## Datasets

- Added `Sell Side Risk Ratio` to all entities
- Added `Open`, `High` and `Low` datasets
- Added `Satoshis Per Dollar`
- Added `All Time High`
- Added `All Time High Date`
- Added `Days Since All Time High`
- Added `Max Days Between All Time Highs`
- Added `Max Years Between All Time Highs`
- Added `Drawdown`
- Added `Adjusted Value Created`, `Adjusted Value Destroyed` and `Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio` to all entities
- Added `Realized Profit To Loss Ratio` to all entities
- Added `Hash Price Min`
- Added `Hash Price Rebound`
- Removed all year datasets (25) in favor for epoch datasets (5), the former was too granular to be really useful
- Removed datasets split by liquidity for all datasets **already split by any address kind**, while fun to have, they took time to compute, ram, and space to store and no one was actually checking them
- Fixed a lot of values in split by liquidity datasets

## Website

- Updated the design yet again which made the website for something more minimal and easier on the eyes
- Added a *Save In Bitcoin* (DCA) simulation page
- ~Added a dashboard~ Added the latest values to the tree next to each option instead, while less values are visible at a time, it's much more readable and organised
- Added a library of PDFs
- Fixed service worker not passing 304 (not modified) response and instead serving cached responses
- Fixed history not being properly registered
- Fixed window being moveable on iOS when in standalone mode when it shouldn't be
- Added `Compare` section to all groups, to compare all datasets within a group
- Updated `Solid Signals` library, which had an important breaking change on the `createEffect` function which might bring some bugs
- Fixed some datasets paths
- A lot of code reorg and file splits
- Adopted a framework like approach to load pages while still being pure JS without a build step
- Probably more that was forgotten

## Parser

- Added a `/datasets/last` json file with all the latest values
- Added `--rpcconnect` parameter to the config
- Added handling of SIGINT and SIGTERM terminal signals which menas you can now safely CTRL+C or kill the parser while it's exporting
- Added config print at the start of the program
- Compressed `empty_address_data` struct to save space (should shave of between up to 50% of the `address_index_to_empty_address_data` database)
- Doubled the number of `txid_to_tx_data` databases from 4096 to 8192
- ~Added `--recompute_computed true` argument, to allow recomputation of computed datasets in case of a bug~ Buggy for now
- Fixed not saved arguments, not being processed properly
- Fixed bug in `generic_map.multi_insert_simple_average`
- Added defragmentation option `--first-defragment true` of databases to save space (which can save up to 50%)
- Fixed bug in the computation of averages in `GenericMap`
- Added support and paramer for cookie files with `--rpccookiefile`, and auto find if the path is `--datadir/.cookie`
- Increased number of retries and time between them when fetching price from exchanges APIs

## Server

- Fixed links in several places missing the `/api` part and thus not working
- Fixed broken last values routes
- Added support for the `/datasets/last` file via the `/api/last` route
- Added support for `.json` (won't change anything) and `.csv` (will download a csv file) extension at the end of datasets routes
- Added `all=true` query parameter to dataset routes to get to full history

## Biter

- Moved back to this repo

# [v0.4.0](https://github.com/kibo-money/kibo/tree/a64c544815d9ef785e2fc1323582f774f16b9200) | [861950](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000000530d0e30ccf7deeace122dcc99f2668a06c6dad83629) - 2024/09/19

- Added datasets compression thanks to [zstd](https://crates.io/crates/zstd) to reduce disk usage
- Use the Bitcoin RPC server for various calls instead of running cli commands and then parsing the JSON from the output
- **Important database changes that will need a full rescan**:
  - Changed databases page size from 1MB to 4KB for improved disk usage
  - Split txid_to_tx_data database in 4096 chunks (from 256) for improved disk usage
  - Split address_index_to_X databases to chunks of 25_000 instead of 50_000
  - Removed local Multisig database
- Updated the config, run with `-h` to see possible args
