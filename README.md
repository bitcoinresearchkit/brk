  A better, FOSS, Bitcoin-only, self-hostable Glassnode.
</p>

## Description

While [mempool.space](https://mempool.space) gives a very micro view of the network where you can follow the journey of any address, this tool is the exact opposite and very complimentary by giving you a much more global/macro view of the flow and various dynamics of the network via thousands of charts.

To promote even more transparency and trust in the network, this project is committed to making on-chain data accessible and verifiable by all, no matter your intentions or financial situation. That is why, the whole project is completely free, from code to services, including a real-time API with thousands and thousands of routes which can be used at will.

**Having anyone be able to easily do a health-check of the network is incredibly important and should be wanted by every single bitcoiner.**

## Donations

This project was started as an answer to the outrageous pricing from Glassnode (and their third tier starting at $833.33/month !).

But it is a lot of work and has been worked on **full-time since November of 2023** and has also been operational since then without any ads.

**At the time of writing (2024-09-12), this project has made around 2,200,000 sats, which is around $1300 or $120/month. While I'm very grateful for all donations, it's sadly unsustainable.**

So if you find this project useful, [please send some sats](https://geyser.fund/project/satonomics/), it would be really appreciated.

If you're a potential sponsor, feel free to contact me in Nostr !

## Warning

This project is in a very early stage. Until more people look at the code and check the various computations, the datasets might be in the worst case completely false.

## Instances

- [kibo.money](https://kibo.money)
- [backup.kibo.money](https://backup.kibo.money)

## Structure

- `parser`: The backbone of the project, it does most of the work by parsing and then computing datasets from the timechain.
- `website`: A web app which displays the generated datasets in various charts and dashboards.
- `server`: A small server which will serve both their resources

## Setup

### Requirements

- 1 TB of free space (will use 60-80% of that)
- A running instance of bitcoin-core with txindex=1 and rpc credentials
- Git

### Docker

Coming soon

### Manual

#### 1. Dependencies

First we need to install Rust

```bash
# Source: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Then we need to `cargo-watch` for the server

```bash
# Source: https://github.com/watchexec/cargo-watch?tab=readme-ov-file#install
cargo install cargo-watch --locked
```

#### 2. Git

```bash
git clone https://github.com/satonomics-org/satonomics.git

cd satonomics
```

#### 3. Parser

```bash
cd parser

# The first run needs several information about your bitcoin-core config
./run.sh --datadir=$HOME/Developer/bitcoin --rpcuser=satoshi --rpcpassword=nakamoto

# Next time you can just do: ./run.sh
# As everything is saved in

cd ..
```

#### Server

```bash
cd server

./run.sh
```

Then the easiest to let others access your server is with `cloudflared` which will also cache requests.

## Philosophy

- **Best**: Replace Glassnode as the go to
- **Diverse**: Have as many charts/datasets as possible and something for everyone
- **Free**: Is and always will be completely free
- **Open**: With a very permissive license
- **Trustless**: You can verify and see exactly how each dataset is computed
- **Independent**: Only one, easily swappable, dependency (Price API)
- **Educational**: By providing many datasets that can be used to describe how Bitcoin works and why
- **Timeless**: Be relevant and usable 10 years from now by being independent and not do address tagging
- **Sovereign**: Be self-hostable on accessible hardware
- **Versatile**: You can view the data in charts, you can download the data, you can fetch the data via an API
- **Accessible**: Free Website and API with all the datasets for everyone

## Brand

### Name

kibō means _**hope**_ in japanese which is what Bitcoin ultimately is for many, hope for a better future.

### Logo

The dove (borrowed from [svgrepo](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/351969/dove) for now) is known to represent hope in many cultures.

The orange background is a wink to Bitcoin and when in a circle, it also represents the sun, which means that while it's our hope for a better future, we still have to be careful with our collective goals and actions, to not end up like Icarus.

## Roadmap

- **More Datasets/Charts**: If a dataset can be computed, it should exist and have its related charts
- **Dashboards**: For a quick and real-time view of the latest data of all the datasets
- **Nostr integration**: First to save preferences, later to add some social functionnality
- **Datasets by block timestamp**: In addition to having datasets by date and height
- **Descriptions**: Add text to describe all charts and what they mean
- **Start9 support**: By making the whole suite much easier to self-host, it's quite rough right now
- **API Documentation**: Highly needed to explain what's what
