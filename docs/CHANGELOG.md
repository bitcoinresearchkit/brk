## [v0.0.111](https://github.com/bitcoinresearchkit/brk/releases/tag/v0.0.111) - 2025-10-03

### Breaking Changes
#### `brk_interface`
- Renamed `metric_count()` method to `distinct_metric_count()` and `vec_count()` to `total_metric_count()` for clearer API semantics distinguishing between unique metric names versus total metric-index combinations ([source](https://github.com/bitcoinresearchkit/brk/blob/v0.0.111/crates/brk_interface/src/lib.rs))
- Consolidated indexes data structure from separate `indexes` vector and `accepted_indexes` map into single `indexes` BTreeMap containing index names as keys and their accepted variants as values
- Removed redundant `index_count()` method in favor of accessing `indexes.len()` directly

#### `brk_mcp`
- Removed `get_index_count()` tool from Model Context Protocol interface as index count can be derived from indexes map length ([source](https://github.com/bitcoinresearchkit/brk/blob/v0.0.111/crates/brk_mcp/src/lib.rs))
- Removed `get_accepted_indexes()` tool, consolidating functionality into enhanced `get_indexes()` tool that returns complete mapping
