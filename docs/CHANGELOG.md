- **OHLC Price Continuity**: Added logic to maintain price continuity between days in OHLC data computation by setting today's opening price to the previous day's closing price, ensuring no gaps in price series when computing daily OHLC from fetched data ([crates/brk_computer/src/vecs/fetched.rs](https://github.com/bitcoinresearchkit/brk/blob/v0.0.61/crates/brk_computer/src/vecs/fetched.rs))

### Internal Changes
- **Struct Mutability**: Added `DerefMut` trait to all OHLC struct variants (OhlcF64, OhlcBtc, OhlcSats, OhlcUsd) enabling mutable access to underlying values
- **Error Handling**: Improved file creation error handling in block recap export with more descriptive panic messages
