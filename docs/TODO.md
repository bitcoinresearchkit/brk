  - _ERROR_
  - _FETCHER_
  - _INDEXER_
    - PERF: parse only the needed block number instead the last 100 blocks
      - maybe using https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getblockhash.html
  - _INTERFACE_
    - DX: Maybe change `json` to:
      ```json
      {
        "price_close": {
          "data": [115976.6, 115943.4],
          "unit": "USD",
          "range": {
            "from": 19627,

      - from to
      - from option<count>
      - to option<count>
      - page + option<per page> default 1000 max 1000

      - FEAT: shows certain series as [scatter plots](https://github.com/tradingview/lightweight-charts/issues/1662) with a solid sma/ema
        - mainly datasets with a big variance like raw `hash_rate`
      - BUG: hide pane if no series on it
      - BUG: fix (and reset) pane size (50/50) when changing charts

      - FEAT: exports (.json, .csv,…)

      - FEAT: Add manual theme switcher, maybe in a smart way to avoid using real estate ?
      - UI: font:
        - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono
