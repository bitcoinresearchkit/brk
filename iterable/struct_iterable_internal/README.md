# Struct Iterable Internal

This crate is a supporting library for the `struct_iterable` crate. It provides the `Iterable` trait which is used in conjunction with the `struct_iterable_derive` crate to provide an easy way to make a struct iterable in Rust.

**Please note:** This crate is not intended to be used directly. If you want to make your structs iterable, please use the `struct_iterable` crate instead.

Please visit the [`struct_iterable` crate on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/struct_iterable) for more information and usage examples.
